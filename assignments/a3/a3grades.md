## Deliverables (10%)

1. [5/5] Code compiles and runs. If the assignment uses JavaFX, it should rely on a local installation (which may require the TAs to modify the makefile)

2. [5/5] Includes a README.txt describing the development environment, and enhancements that you implemented.

## Functional Requirements (50%)

3. [5/5] The application runs in a window on the desktop. It includes splash screen and a game screen.

4. [5/5] The game screen has a snake that moves forward. 

5. [5/5] The game supports correct keyboard controls for interacting with the game. 

6. [5/5] The game spawns fruits correctly at the start of each level.

7. [5/5] The game has appropriate snake movement speed for each level.

8. [10/10] The snake can be controlled using movement keys, and can be made to eat fruit. Fruit that is eaten gets replaced by randomly positioned fruit.

9. [5/5] If the snake eats itself, or if it collides with the wall, it dies.

10. [5/5] The game has appropriate time constraints for each level. When the timer runs out, the game progresses to the next level.

11. [5/5] When the player dies, a Game Over screen is shown.

## Technical Requirements (30%)

12. [10/10] The game draws correctly and the animation appears smooth.

13. [10/10] The application runs with Java 12 or higher.

14. [10/10] The application specifically relies on Swing or JavaFX for its implementation.
