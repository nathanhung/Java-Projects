## Deliverables (5%)

1. [5/5] Appropriate project files and readme.txt. Code compiles and runs with make file.

## Interface displays, and includes required functionality. (15%)

2. [5/5] The application consists of a single screen with an image container and a main toolbar.

3. [1/5] There are clear mechanisms to clear the images, load a set of images, and filter images. These can appear on the main toolbar or a secondary toolbar.

-1.5 There is no UI mechanism to clear the images.
-1.5 There is no UI mechanism to load a set of images.
-1 Filter is not correct UI mechanism

4. [2/5] The "Ratings" widget appears in the grid below each image.

-3 The "Ratings" widget does not display 5 stars in a graphical format.

## Grid and List layouts supported. (25%)

5. [10/10] Grid Layout shows a fixed number of columns (2 or more). No horizontal bar should appear.

6. [10/10] List Layout shows a single column. No horizontal bar should appear.

7. [5/5] Layout can be toggled between grid and list layouts with two buttons

## Load and view images and metadata. (20%)

8. [10/10] The "Load Images" button should clear the image layout and ratings. It should also load the appropriate images and display them.

9. [5/5] The application should support loading and displaying multiple formats, including JPG and PNG.

10.  [5/5] Clicking on an image shows an enlarged image in a separate window with the rating bar. There is a way of closing the window.

## Rank images, filter based on ranking. (20%)

11.  [5/5] Individual images can be ranked by changing the rating for the image.

12. [10/10] The ratings filter on the toolbar filters out the images that don't meet the specified rating or higher.

13. [5/5] Changing the rating of an image should immediately be reflected in the list (i.e. if it no longer meets the filter criteria, it should disappear).

## Resizing handled appropriately based on layout. (15%)

14. [8/8] When resizing the window in Grid Layout, space is constrained / allocated correctly.

15. [7/7] When resizing the window in List Layout, space is constrained / allocated correctly.
